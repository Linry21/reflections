\b \cf2 What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?\
\
pros: You can decide it on your own mind when to commit it. \
cons: If you forget it sometimes, it will generate a dangerous result without committing it.\
\
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?\
It is more efficient to look through the several files made changes at the same time.\
\
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?\
To use git log to look all the commit in the repository and use git diff to view the changes in two version.\
